# Mapping global greenhouse gases emissions

The goal of this project is to build sankey diagrams to represent all possible calculation scopes for greenhouse gases footprints. We use EXIOBASE3 to calculate the footprints and plotly.graph_objs.sankey to build the diagrams. 

## Requirements

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Running runme.py requires 50GB of disk space as it will download all exiobase data.

```bash
$ python runme.py
```
It will:

* download EXIOBASE data and save it in Data/EXIO3
* download Kbar data and save it in Data/Kbar, convert files to .feather
* run functions from exiobase_functions.py to calculate the footprints
* run functions from sankey_function.py to generate files that will be used as inputs for building the sankey diagrams
* run save_sankey() from fig_sankey.py to generation sankey figures and save them in Results/Sankey_figs

## Application

The application to visualize all the sankey diagrams is available in another repository: https://github.com/baptiste-an/Application-mapping-GHG


## Run Python 3.10 with pyenv

To install requirements.txt above, you may need Python 3.10.  Check your version using `python --version`.  You can run pyenv to toggle your python versions. [About pyenv](https://model.earth/io/coders/python/).

To run Python 3.10, right-click your local repo and open a terminal.  
(You can skip this first step if you've already installed 3.10)

	pyenv install 3.10

<!--
Optional, since a .python-version file already resides in the repo.

	pyenv local 3.10
-->

Delete your existing "env" folder before running this step if you're debugging.

	python3.10 -m venv env

On Mac/Linux run:

	source env/bin/activate

On Windows run:

	.\env\Scripts\activate
	

Confirm the version with `python -V` and continue with the requirments.txt install above.
